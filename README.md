# SecureHomeNet: A Virutalized Network Security Lab

## Objective

The objective of this project is to establish and secure a controlled home network environment using virtualization technology. By creating a lab consisting of multiple virtual machines, this project aims to demonstrate network segmentation, firewall configuration, and the deployment of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The goal is to simulate real-world network scenarios, enforce security policies, and showcase the ability to detect and respond to potential security threats. Through this project, the intended outcomes are to gain hands-on experience with virtualization software, network segmentation, firewall configuration, and IDS systems, ultimately enhancing the understanding and application of network security best practices.

### Skills Learned

-  Virtualization using VMware
-  Network segmentation
-  Firewall configuration (PfSense)
-  IDS/IPS deployment and configuration (Snort on PfSense)
-  Network traffic monitoring and analysis
-  Basic network security best practices
-  Hands-on experience with Windows XP, Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 12.0.0, and PfSense

Ref 2: Use of aliases in pfsense
It is used in PfSense to group IP addresses for easier management and reference in firewall rules. It is created for gateway IP addresses (192.168.199.1 and 192.168.94.1) to simplify rule creation and maintenance which allowed for more readable and organized firewall rules by replacing IP addresses with descriptive names (e.g., "Gateway").
